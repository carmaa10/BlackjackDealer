as ten points|false

The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. Except, a "blackjack" 
is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, and it outranks all other 
21-point hands|false 
*
After the players have bet, the dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to itself. 
Players can only see one of the cards|false
*
If the dealer has a ten or an ace showing, it will check to see if the second card is an ace or a 
ten|false

If the dealer does have a blackjack, then all wagers will lose, unless the player also has a 
blackjack, which will result in a push.|false

Play begins with the player to the dealer's left. The following are the choices available 
to the player:
	Stay: Player stays put with their cards.
	Hit: Player draws another card (and more if they wish). If this card causes the 
	player's total points to exceed 21 (known as busting) then they lose.|false 
*
After each player has had their turn, the dealer will turn over its hidden card. If the dealer 
has 16 or less, then it will draw another card.|false 
*
If the dealer goes over 21 points, then any player who didn't already bust will win.|false 
*
If the dealer does not bust, then the higher point total between the player and dealer will win.|false 
*
Winning wagers pay more money. Normally, the player's bet is doubled; however, if they got a 
blackjack, they get triple their bet.|true

There are a few ways to bet:
	Every man for himself (the default)
		Every player bets only for themselves, meaning that they lose that amount if they lose or collect winnings based on that bet
	Three Musketeers
		"All for one and one for all," all players' bets are put into a pool. If any of the players win, the winnings are divided amongst the players, and it's all gone if everyone loses|true
