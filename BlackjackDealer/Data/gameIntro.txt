Alright, so here's the deal (pun intended).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start off, there's one deck of 52 cards, and you'll be betting on those cards with a starting 
amount of $500, and there will be a total of 5 rounds, that is unless both players go bankrupt 
in that time. 

Good luck, and have fun!
